Cassandra Examples
==================

This is a collection of simple and illustrative Cassandra applications. The purpose of this collection is to help new Cassandra users better understand Cassandra and to present illustrative use cases. 

Getting started
---------------

If you don't have access to a Cassandra cluster, you can get started by installing [Ferry](http://ferry.opencore.io). Ferry is an open-source tool that helps developers provision virtual clusters on a local machine. Ferry supports Cassandra (and other "big data" tools) and doesn't require that you actually know how to configure Cassandra to get started. 

Contributing
============

If you're interested in contributing an application, please send a pull request. Your application should include a `README.md` to describe the application and any special instructions for running the application.
